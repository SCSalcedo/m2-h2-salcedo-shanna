    <h1>Let's start with a name:</h1>
    <p> Hello, my name is Shanna! I graduated from Florida State University with a degree
        in Professional Communication and a minor in Education. My plan was to teach English 
        abroad in Paraguay with the Peace Corps. Due to the pandemic, I was not able to do so.
        I still continued to travel visiting the Dominican Republic, Panama, Ecuador, and Peru.
        One way I was able to travel cheaply was by working in exchange for accomodation and food.
        I used a website called <a href="https://www.workaway.info/">workaway.info</a> and found some jobs where I would create webpages (through wordpress/wix)
        and take photos for hostels.
    
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies and Interests </h2>
    <p>Of course, one of my biggest interests is traveling. I love the feeling of 
        going new places and trying new things. While traveling, I also picked up photography.
        Recently, I've been spending more time at home so I started making rugs. I saw a 
        video online of someone making a rug and boom, I turned one of the rooms in my house
        into a tufting studio.
